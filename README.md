# Set-Plasma
[Set](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQdLnBNAWYIqDoYLjBPcyh3Pjo0rcQMZtjcrOzIYVek/edit?usp=sharing) protocol extension of Plasma. A state-channels, plasma, and verification game approach to scaling complex layer2 applications.

[Theory - WIP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15LdH-YL3syBHdHlwCfUHou6XFvg5lXBKtrAFp5bG1Pc/edit?usp=sharing)

This implementation aims to achieve scalable
  - Ether payments
  - ERC20 payments
  - NFT exchanges
  - NFT simple market
  - NFT discovery (communal process)
  - complex state-channel logic
  - verification game channels
  
  
### Hub-and-spoke / Operator

The consesus mechanism chosen for this layer2 plasma chain is PoA. We provide safe exits and a client library to allow anyone to easliy reboot a corrupt plasma chain or to simply compete with better fees.
